## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SCSS Languaje

### What I learned

This challenge allow me to practicing more with auto-selection tags like `*:nth-child()` of CSS and nested values on SCSS using SASS languaje for styles. Instead I used flex-box for sorting elements, the flex-wrap it was not better way to sort elements in mobile view, for solving this, I used `@media` css property and set break width resolution for changing some values and sort all card into a column. 


```scss
@media  screen and (max-width: 900px)
```
```scss
@media  screen and (min-width: 901px)
```

Theese lines exchanges settings from some values like `flex-direction:` and `border-radius:` to improve visualitation on several resolution devices.
